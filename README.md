# Enterprise Network Design
<p><strong><u>Introduction</u></strong></p>
<p><strong><u>&nbsp;</u></strong></p>
<p>Networking and Security technology is the most advanced technology in today&rsquo;s world. The world is now connected with various networks in and around us. Being it wired or wireless, networking fundamentals are the pillar of today&rsquo;s internet. Internet is required now a days in almost all houses. Internet is mainly the interchanging of data packets between sender and receiver. In this project, I have designed a network enterprise design which is nothing but establishment of a communication channel between the sender and the receiver.</p>
<p>In wide spreading of the networking technology and securities, cyber crime is also happening now a days, so to overcome that cybercrime, cyber security is implemented. In each data packets forwarding, utmost security is given to block the unwanted data stealing from the dark web. In this project work, I have designed the network topology between internet service provider and the organization. In the given problem statement, the organization network is divided into four networks A, B, C and D each having different number of hosts. The class for the address is class C, that is there will be three blocks assigned for Network IDs and one block for Host IDs.</p>

<p><strong><u>Brief Idea About the Project Work</u></strong></p>
<p><strong><u>&nbsp;</u></strong></p>
<p>This project is based on enterprise network design, which means we have to design a specific network topology for an enterprise that can forward data packets from the service provider to the respective organization. Here, I will simulate the network by checking all the necessary connections, that have to be established within the network. Moreover, this project is designed in such a way that it covers all the important protocols that have been implemented in networking and security now a days.</p>
<p>I have used Cisco Packet Tracer for doing the whole project. Configuring all the necessary connections and taking the cisco routers are taken into account carefully. Different types of routing protocols that is OSPF, configuring a DHCP and FTP server is also noteworthy.</p>
<p>An enterprise network consists of physical and virtual networks and protocols that serve the dual purpose of connecting all users and systems on a local area network (LAN) to applications in the data centre and cloud as well as facilitating access to network data and analytics.</p>
<p>Now a days, this network enterprise design is the most important in the field of networking and security technology and is spreading very widely day to day as we grow up.</p>

<p><strong><u>Methodology to be adopted</u></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>First of all, the network topology is made based on the problem statement given. Internet Service Provider (ISP) router is used as the topmost router which can provide data packets to be moved to the organization router.</li>
<li>Next, three consecutive routers of type 2961 Cisco Routers are placed for respective networks, A to D.</li>
<li>Network A and B is marked as router 0, network C is equipped with router 1, network D is implemented with router 3 based on the configuration setup.</li>
<li>After all the routers are placed properly, switch of type 2960 is placed just after router 1,2 and 3 for setup of end devices such as laptops, PCs and servers.</li>
<li>Proper connection is carried out by connecting three organization routers with Gigabyte ports and the connection between ISP and Organization router is made through Serial connectivity port.</li>
<li>Routers and switches are also connected through gigabyte ports. If in case, gigabyte ports are not available, then powering off the router, and taking LAN Cards from the physical section of the router and then again turn on the router will serve the purpose of gigabyte connectivity.</li>
<li>Connecting the switches with PCs and DHCP Servers require fast ethernet ports.</li>
<li>After making all the connections, now the main configurations are carried out inside the network. Assigning all the IP Address to each of the router through Command Line Interface window is done.</li>
<li>Setting up the DHCP and FTP Server with the IP Address and connection of VLAN is done.</li>
<li>By checking all the connections, the network enterprise design is configured and ready for sending and receiving data packets from the host to its destination address.</li>

<li><u>ISP and Organization Router (Type 2961 Cisco Router)</u>:</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ISP stands for Internet Service Provider. A router basically sends data on computer networks. It is typically connected to a modem. It sends information from the internet to personal devices like computers, phones, and tablets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><u>Switch (Type 2960 Cisco Switch)</u>:</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A network switch (also called switching hub, bridging hub, and, by the IEEE, MAC bridge) is networking hardware that connects devices on a computer network by using packet switching to receive and forward data to the destination device. A network switch is a multiport network bridge that uses MAC addresses to forward data at the data link layer (layer 2) of the OSI model. Some switches can also forward data at the network layer (layer 3) by additionally incorporating routing functionality. Such switches are commonly known as layer-3 switches or multilayer switches.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><u>Web Server</u>:</li>
</ol>
<p>A Web server is a program that uses HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) to serve the files that form Web pages to users, in response to their requests, which are forwarded by their computers' HTTP clients. Dedicated computers and appliances may be referred to as Web servers as well. The process is an example of the client/server model.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><u>FTP Server</u>:</li>
</ol>
<p>FTP Server (which stands for File Transfer Protocol Server) is a software application which enables the transfer of files from one computer to another. FTP is a way to transfer files to any computer in the world that is connected to the internet.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><u>DHCP Server</u>:</li>
</ol>
<p>A DHCP Server is a network server that automatically provides and assigns IP addresses, default gateways and other network parameters to client devices. It relies on the standard protocol known as Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol or DHCP to respond to broadcast queries by clients.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="6">
<li><u>VLAN</u>:</li>
</ol>
<p>A VLAN is a custom network created from one or more existing LANs. It enables groups of devices from multiple networks (both wired and wireless) to be combined into a single logical network. The result is a virtual LAN that can be administered like a physical local area network. The primary advantage of VLAN is that it reduces the size of broadcast domains. The drawback of VLAN is that an injected packet may lead to a cyber-attack.</p>

<li><strong><u>Discussion about the Network Topology</u></strong>:</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp; As per the project, ISP grants a class C IP Address to an enterprise. The I.P Address of the network is 202.195.32.0 with a CIDR value of /24. That means the subnet mask of the above network will become 255.255.255.0</p>
<p>The three organization routers are connected via three links with each other through gigabyte ports in such a way that it can ensure forwarding of data packets from one router to another. This data packets are then fed into the switches that goes straight to the end devices such as laptops, PCs and servers. Here, different types of servers have been implemented into the project like Web Server, FTP server, DHCP Server etc. From the given problem, we can accomplish that network A consist of 30 number of hosts, network B consist of 30 number of hosts, network C consist of 60&nbsp; umber of host and network D is having 12 hosts. While connecting the routers with the switches, first of all, we will assign the I.P Address to each of the routers in the specific ports. Router 1 having 0/0 gigabyte port is connected to router 2 having same 0/0 gigabyte ethernet port with I.P. assigned as 202.195.32.145 . By the same process, we have connected other two routers with each other with I.P addresses as 202.195.32.149 and 202.195.32.153 . Router 1 is connected with two switches, one for network A consisting of 30 hosts and a VLAN 10 and 20. Other switch is configured through network B having 30 hosts and a VLAN 10 and 20 respectively. &nbsp;A DHCP server is connected with network B but it is not connected to the internet. The port address/mac table for the routers is shown below with the diagrammatic representation.</p>

<p>Switch is configured with network A and B with respective VLANS of 10 and 20 and afterwards, the inter VLAN routing is implemented into it. All the end devices are being assigned with Ip Addresses and a default gateway is marked out to easily allow the transfer of data packets from the desirable location to its destination address without being the packets failed at a certain moment. In this project, network C is accomplished with 12 number of hosts, coming from router 2. The diagrammatic representation of all the end devices and switches are listed below:</p>

<p><strong><u>CONCLUSION</u></strong></p>
<p><strong><u>&nbsp;</u></strong></p>
<p>A network is defined as the connection of at least two computer systems, either by a cable or a wireless connection. The simplest network is a combination of two computers connected by a cable. This type of network is called a peer-to-peer network.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we can say that the packets of data are moving from one source to its desired destination through the whole IP Routing process and the internet service provider is providing us the internet through which we can communicate throughout the channel or entire network of IP Addressing. Network designing is one of the vital roles in making sure that it needs the objective. Network is a connected collection of devices and end systems, such as computers and servers, which can communicate with each other. The screenshot of the whole project is attached below at the end of this conclusion.</p>
<p>This project is based on enterprise network design, which means we have to design a specific network topology for an enterprise that can forward data packets from the service provider to the respective organization. Here, I will simulate the network by checking all the necessary connections, that have to be established within the network. Moreover, this project is designed in such a way that it covers all the important protocols that have been implemented in networking and security now a days. I have used Cisco Packet Tracer for doing the whole project. Configuring all the necessary connections and taking the cisco routers are taken into account carefully. Different types of routing protocols that is OSPF, configuring a DHCP and FTP server is also noteworthy. An enterprise network consists of physical and virtual networks and protocols that serve the dual purpose of connecting all users and systems on a local area network (LAN) to applications in the data centre and cloud as well as facilitating access to network data and analytics. Now a days, this network enterprise design is the most important in the field of networking and security technology and is spreading very widely day to day as we grow up </p>
